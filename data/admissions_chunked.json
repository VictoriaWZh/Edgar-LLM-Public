The primary reason we don’t offer AP is because it flies in the face of our mission. AP classes are survey classes. They aim to cover as much of the waterfront as possible. EPS is interested in the opposite; our program is designed to go deep, to explore fewer concepts and ideas, but to do so in a way that achieves genuine understanding.

Our focus on student well-being centers on students feeling safe and supported at EPS. In addition to ensuring students’ physical safety, we also attend to their social and emotional safety needs. Regular drills for unforeseen incidents help us ensure we can always be prepared in any event. Safety and security discussions occur in advisory groups; as a preparatory school, we help students prepare for many potential situations they will encounter in their lives. Security personnel coverage both during the school day and after hours, helps us to bring specialized support in addition to the vigilance of all school employees. Three full-time school counselors help to ensure that experiencing social and emotional safety is an aspect in which all students are supported. All employees, substitute teaching staff, and volunteers who will not be directly supervised while on campus have gone through background checks before engaging with our school community. Key fob access for entry doors on an auto-locking schedule helps us to reduce risk by limiting entry points to campus buildings."},

These events include our new parent welcome evening, grade-level picnics, parent coffees, celebratory events for parents, and parent-teacher advisory conferences. Many parents also choose to volunteer at EPS through our Parent Association. Opportunities include serving as a grade-level parent representative, contributing to events such as our faculty-staff appreciation days, and assisting our athletic teams. We’re happy parents and guardians can be as involved as their interests and schedules allow.  While volunteer opportunities are offered, they are not required."},

In addition to sharing campus spaces such as our cafeteria, gymnasium, and arts classrooms, Middle and Upper School students interact regularly both during and after school. Each Middle School advisory group is paired with two to three Peer Mentors from the Upper School, joining them on a regular basis to help lead discussions and activities. Classes collaborate on academic projects, for example, our seventh and eleventh graders created historical maps together, and our sixth and tenth graders worked on science labs and presentation skills together. Opportunities for these collaborations vary from year to year. Each year, EPS produces an all-school musical in which all grade levels participate on stage and behind the scenes. Many of our musical ensembles feature a mixture of student grades as well. Additionally, Upper School students assist as leaders in many Middle School sports teams."},

If you are looking for a local testing location, please feel free to contact us at admissions@eastsideprep.org, and we will do our best to help. SSAT and ISEE are used by independent schools worldwide and are designed to measure the basic verbal, quantitative, and reading skills students develop over time. Each applicant must take one of these tests with no preference between testing types; both tests are not required. Note: This is a required component for all applicants to register for the SSAT or ISEE. However, this is not a Ravenna-required step because registration and score submission takes place directly through SSAT or ISEE, not through Ravenna. Eastside Prep uses admissions testing as one component of our holistic admissions review. We do not have minimum scores for admissions consideration. We review student-written essays as well as the admissions test scores on multiple choice sections. We understand that admissions testing provides a ‘snapshot’ of students’ performance on the tests on just one day in time, and that some students may have more experience with these types of tests. We encourage students to be familiar with the testing format through taking a practice test, however extensive test preparation is not an expectation or requirement. We recommend that students endeavor to have the best night’s sleep possible before the test, have a good breakfast the day of the test, and to pack snacks and water to enjoy during the testing breaks.

If you have created your own program as a family, we recommend that you briefly list some topics/skills/experiences by academic discipline areas. For example: History Topics: Pacific Northwest history, US History to 1845 Skills: Reading primary source documents, writing reflective essays on critical thinking prompts, creating interactive history timelines Experiences: Visiting Washington State History Museum online, visiting Fort Nisqually We recommend including any and all disciplines/subjects included in the homeschool experience. Please include any physical education and creative expression as these are part of our EPS core program. Teacher Evaluations: It is most helpful to hear from a parent or guardian about their student in the Parent/Guardian Statements component of the admissions application. Rather than also completing the teacher evaluation as a parent, we recommend that you delegate the teacher evaluation forms to anyone who knows your student in an educational context outside of your family. This could include current or prior year teachers, tutors, coaches, or anyone who has taught a unit or module of study to your student that has been part of their homeschooling. If your student has solely had you as their educator, then it would be appropriate to complete a teacher evaluation as a parent/guardian."},

Note: a student who is entering their third year of school in the U.S., and who is no longer enrolled in an ELL/ESL curriculum, may be considered for admission without needing to submit TOEFL or TOEFL Jr. scores. This type of student would apply for admission with a domestic application. Eastside Prep provides an I-20 form for any enrolled student who requires an F-1 visa in order to attend school in the United States. International Student Housing While attending Eastside Preparatory School, all international students must reside with an immediate family member. Eastside Prep will not consider international applicants if they plan to live on their own, in an independent dorm environment, or at a homestay. The Application Fee for an International Application is $100. International Student Applicant Checklist In addition to the items required on the standard applications, International Applications require the following: Student Records (completed online with Ravenna Hub) International Applicants must provide translated grade reports if the reports are not already in English. English Language Proficiency Testing Take an English Proficiency Test Eastside Prep does not have an ESL program, so students must demonstrate highly proficient ability to both speak English and learn in English. Applicants must submit English proficiency test scores as part of the application process. Eastside Prep prefers the TOEFL or TOEFL Jr., but all of these test options are acceptable. The scores listed are the typical score range for accepted students. TOEFL: Typical score range for an accepted student is iBT 70 to 90 TOEFL Jr.: TOEFL Jr. is an option for 9th and 10th grade applicants.

Section One: The assessment starts with three (3) video questions for which you’ll provide recorded video responses. Students, you will watch a pre-recorded video of an EPS community member asking you a question. Before you record your video response, you will have a minute to think about your answers. If it helps your thinking process, you can jot down notes about what you’d like to say when the recording begins. You’ll see the question appear in writing on the screen if you need to refer back to it as you respond. You’ll see a time clock elapse during your preparation time, as well as during that time you have to answer each question. Middle School applicants have one minute to answer each question; Upper School applicants have two minutes to answer each question. You can hit submit as soon as you are done responding to the question, even if there is still time remaining. You don’t need to wait for the timer to end. Section Two: The assessment concludes with two (2) questions requiring recorded written responses. You’ll watch a video of an EPS community member asking you a question. Then, you’ll see that question written on the screen. Once you receive this written prompt, you’ll have two minutes to think about your answer.

Parents can support their students while they get set up on the platform, completing the technology check and practice questions. Since the online assessment is intended for us to get to know students directly in their own words and voice, we recommend giving students space once they are set up on the platform. If you are staying close by, parents, please consider if you will be a calming presence without influencing your student’s responses to our questions.
