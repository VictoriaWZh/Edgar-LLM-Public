The Parent/Guardian Statement allows us to understand better, in your own words, who your student is, who you are as a family, and what you\u2019re looking for in a school. Student Interests & Activities give us further insight into who your student is and what they like to do. We can imagine how your students might connect with and participate in our school community through this information. The Student Essay provides insights into how students think about a topic, as well as their writing style, in one to two paragraphs (250 words). Student Short Answers capture a student\u2019s personality through brief, in-the-moment responses. School Records help us see how your student has grown and progressed over their last three years of schooling, including areas of strength and areas where they can continue to grow. This helps us to understand where a student is academically and whether they\u2019re prepared to enter their application grade at EPS. Teacher Evaluations give us an in-the-classroom view of how a student interacts with peers and teachers. We hear teachers\u2019 firsthand experiences with the students. This allows us to visualize how your student will engage with the EPS community.\n\nLEARNING THROUGH EXPERIENCE & EDUCATION BEYOND THE CLASSROOM (EBC) Learning through experience is a component of all EPS courses, and excursions beyond campus support a deeper integration of knowledge. \u00ce All students attend a two-day orientation at the start of school, featuring overnight stays for sixth, ninth, and twelfth grades. \u00ce Service opportunities deepen students\u2019 understanding of the needs, issues and problems facing their community and the world, empowering students to understand their roles in meeting those needs, addressing those issues, and solving those problems. \u00ce During Culture Night, EPS families share experience-oriented exhibits and learn from others as they laugh, sing, eat, and dance together. \u00ce Education Beyond the Classroom (EBC) offers a wide variety of week-long experiences focused on arts, science, history, culture, the environment, and service. \u00ce Field trips to the Seattle Aquarium, King County Courthouse, Seattle Asian Art Museum (and many more locations!) enhance student learning.
